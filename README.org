* Obtaining
  You can download the source code for the assignments form Github:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone https://github.com/wvxvw/introduction-to-data-structures.git
  #+END_SRC

* Compiling
  The exercises contain some C code.  To compile it, you would need to
  have a C compiler on your system (I used GCC 5.3.1).  The code inside should
  be just the standard C99.  The project comes with a [[./assignment/Makefile][Makefile]].  You can use
  it to build the project by running:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    make
  #+END_SRC

* Documentation
  You can also generate HTML documenation for the project using:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    make doc
  #+END_SRC

* Running
  Once compiled, you should be able to run the code by:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd ./assignment11 && ./assignment11
  #+END_SRC
