Before there were computers, there were algorithms. But now that there
are computers, there are even more algorithms, and algorithms lie at
the heart of computing.

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of
computer algorithms. It presents many algorithms and covers them in
considerable depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to
all levels of readers. We have tried to keep explanations elementary
without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

Each chapter presents an algorithm, a design technique, an application
area, or a related topic. Algorithms are described in English and in a
pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little
programming. The book contains 244 figures—many with multiple
parts—illustrating how the algorithms work. Since we emphasize
efficiency as a design criterion, we include careful analyses of the
running times of all our algorithms.

The text is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate
courses in algorithms or data structures. Because it discusses
engineering issues in algorithm design, as well as mathematical
aspects, it is equally well suited for self-study by technical
professionals.

In this, the third edition, we have once again updated the entire
book. The changes cover a broad spectrum, including new chapters,
revised pseudocode, and a more active writing style.
